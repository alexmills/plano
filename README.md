# Project Plano

Toyota-inspired infotainment system built with Flutter to run on Ubuntu Core

## Please Read First

I'm glad you're here and I hope you get some benefit from this code but please keep a few things in mind. This is my **first open source** project, I'm learning Dart and Flutter as I go, and this will be built specifically for me initially so a bunch of things will be hardcoded.

## What is it?

Plano is an attempt to build a new headunit for my 2019 Toyota Hilux, which currently has an aging touchscreen navigation system in it. I'm using a 9 Inch 2K capacitive touch screen display powered by either a RaspberryPi or Nvidia Jetson.

## What's next?

I'll continue to build this readme out as the project progresses. I'll be posting updates on [hashnode](https://alexmills.hashnode.dev) and more than likely, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexmills) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/thealexmills). 

## What does it look like

## What will it look like?

Hopefully something like this anyway...
