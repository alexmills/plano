# Radio Tech Notes 

My unit is the SR5 Navigation-spec while the secondhand donor unit is from an SR. Same screen but no Nav.

The Wiring ID refers to the G### number in the wiring diagram, which affects connector pinouts.

Care has to be taken to make sure the right harness is used for each unit.

| Unit | Fascia ID | Model | Wiring ID |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| SR5 | 100409 | 86100-OK140 | ? |
| SR | 100405 | 86140-OK200 | ? |

## Reverse Camera

Only two non-2020 models have reverse camera inputs.

- DR - G38 - B
- NR - G114 - L

## 2020 8-Inch Models

These are easier to figure out on the wiring diagram as there is only one each of the **Display Receiver** and **Navigation Receiver** type units.

- DR - G203 - Q
- NR - G208 - Y

They can be ignored in the wiring diagram.
